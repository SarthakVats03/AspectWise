# Speakers Dataset

## How it's generated

This dataset is generated by passing prompts to ChatGPT.

## How it's structured

This folder is structured in such a way that first we will consider the brands of the speakers. They are our targets:

1. Sony
2. JBL
3. Bose

Each Brand has an overall sentiment/review about the aspects of the features. The aspects are:

1. Bass Quality
2. Build Quality
3. Price

For each target-aspect pair, we can have three sentiments, that is `positive`, `negative` and `neutral`. For each pair, there have been reviews generated.

## How to use it

Based on what you think the sentiment polarity should all the target-aspect pairs, train your classifer model based on those target-aspect-sentiment files. For each of those files, the label is the target-aspect pair, and for all the reviews in the file.
